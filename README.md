# Diabetes_ML
Using machine learning to model common diabetes symptoms into a diagnosing model.
Data is obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/early-diabetes-classification/version/1

modeling.ipynb is the notebook where modeling took place.

Diabetes_ML.pdf has a brief summary of the methods and results.
diabetes_data_tree.pdf shows an example graphic of the default decision tree model.
rf_feature_import.png shows the feature importance of the random forest classification model.
diabetes_data_countplot shows the initial data plotting.

Note: these notebooks were created using the VSCode notebook extension. There seems to be compatibility between Jupyter Lab and VSCode (relating to the EOL terminators used in both).
